# AP CSA Notes Repository

Welcome to the AP Computer Science A (AP CSA) Notes Repository. This is where all of the AP CSA notes will reside, intended to help you study and understand the course material.

## Note

These notes are based on the 2022 Barron's AP Book. For my students at AI Code Academy, note the chapters covered in each course:

### Pre-AP Computer Science A (Introduction to Java)
- **Chapter 2**: Introductory Java Language Features
- **Chapter 7**: Arrays and ArrayList
- **Chapter 3**: Classes and Objects
- **Chapter 5**: Some Standard Classes

### AP Computer Science A
- **Chapter 6**: Program Design and Analysis
- **Chapter 4**: Inheritance and Polymorphism 
- **Chapter 8**: Recursion 
- **Chapter 9**: Sorting and Searching 

The course order is designed to optimize learning. We believe this sequence best supports student understanding.

## Pre-AP Computer Science A (Introduction to Java)

This introductory class on Java focuses on syntax and reasoning. The projects are simple and short, as the course duration is only 2 weeks. Homework is non-mandatory but highly recommended.

Refer to the note above to locate your notes in the respective folders.
